                I was born in Charleston, SC in 1985.  My family owned 
                a large plot of land right on a river just outside of town.  I think thats why I developed a love for the water.

These four years would be some of the most formative of my entire life.  They set the stage for me to learn that I loved to travel and experience other cultures around the world.

                Being a <i>veteran</i> would open many doors for me professionally.  I would go on to be recruited by Rockwell Automation for a program exclusively for veterans to train and replace an aging work force in the manufacturing industry.  This is where I learned programming fundamentals that ultimately led me to where I am today, enrolled in a full stack web development immersive program and hopefully leading toward starting my own company...
